## Overview
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes. This project trains a CNN to classify these images.

## Dataset
Download the dataset from [here](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).

## Model Architecture
The model includes:
- Convolutional layers
- Max-pooling layers
- Fully connected layers
- Dropout for regularization

Here is a visualization of the model architecture:
